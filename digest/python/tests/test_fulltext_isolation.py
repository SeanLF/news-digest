"""Tests for the hard bound on fulltext.py's fetch+extract work.

An in-process deadline bounds the waiter, not the work, so the bound is enforced from OUTSIDE
by a process (``docs/lessons/a-deadline-on-the-waiter-does-not-bound-the-worker.md``). Unlike
``test_fulltext.py``, which inlines the collector so it can script outcomes with fakes, nothing
here is faked: real child processes, real ``subprocess`` kills, and real trafilatura against a
loopback HTTP server. This is the only place the production path is proved, so it pays the
seconds deliberately. Forked with fulltext.py from newsroom/tests/.
