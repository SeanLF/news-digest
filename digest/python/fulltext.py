"""Full-text fetch and extract (trafilatura) for the digest workflow's `fetchFulltext` activity.

The TypeScript side plans the tasks and stores the result (digest/src/activities/fulltext.ts); this
module only turns (article_id, url) pairs into extracted text. Forked from newsroom/src/fulltext.py,
which retired with the Python pipeline at the cut-over.

THE INVARIANT: no URL reaches a model or a log line. Results are keyed by article_id; log lines name
the domain only.

Best-effort: a failed fetch, a dead worker or a bug here is "no full text" for that article, never
an exception out of `_collect_isolated`.

THE BOUND: no fetch may outlive the step. A thread cannot be killed from Python, so the fetching
runs in a CHILD PROCESS (`python -m fulltext --worker`, fed its task list on stdin, emitting
results as JSONL on stdout) that the parent kills when the hard bound expires. The child keeps
the in-process deadline as its own soft budget, so the kill is only ever the backstop.
See docs/lessons/a-deadline-on-the-waiter-does-not-bound-the-worker.md.

    Results come back as JSONL on stdout, flushed per line, so a kill costs only the unfinished
    fetches. `subprocess.run` attaches partial output to the TimeoutExpired it raises, which is
    what lets the killed path and the normal path share the code below.

    Never raises: a worker that cannot start, crashes, or is killed is the same "no full text"
    outcome as a batch of failed fetches, and the caller falls back to the CSV summaries.
