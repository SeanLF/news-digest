The user message holds RSS article titles from the past week, one per line.

Summarise the major themes in 2-3 sentences. Note any multi-day themes that developed over the week. Do NOT reproduce specific headlines or titles. Write in paragraph format only.

Reply with the summary and nothing else: no preamble, no heading, no quotation marks.
